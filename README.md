# GPz
Non-stationary sparse Gaussian processes for heteroscedastic uncertainty estimation

## Introduction
This is a Matlab and a python implementations of the methods described in [Almosallam et. al]() for non-stationary sparse Gaussian processes with heteroscedastic noise. The model optimizes the probability of the data being generated by a linear combination of radial basis functions (RBF) with the following options:

  - **Global length-scale (GL)**: All the basis functions share the same length scale.
  - **Variable length-scale (VL)**: Each basis has a specific length-scale.
  - **Global Diagonal (GD)**: All the basis functions share the same diagonal covariance.
  - **Variable Diagonal (VL)**: Each basis has a specific diagonal covariance.
  - **Global Covariance (GC)**: All the basis functions share the same full covariance.
  - **Variable Covariance (GC)**: Each basis has a specific full covariance.

### Joint Linear Prior Optimization
The models allows for an optional linear prior optimization, i.e. the data is genererated by 
## Terminolog
  - **Joint**: 
  - **numpy**
  - **matplotlib**
  - **sklearn**
## Requirements:

### Matlab:

Download the [minFunc](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Software/minFunc_2012.zip) optimization package 

### Python:

  - **scipy**
  - **numpy**
  - **matplotlib**
  - **sklearn**

To install, type the following in the command line:
```bash
pip install package_name
```

## Running:

There are two starter codes available:

  - **demo_sin**: A simple univariate example using all the default options with minimal configuration
  - **demo_photoz**: A more advanced script showing how to configure all available options on a photo-z sample
